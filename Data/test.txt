Typically, in an apartment rental dataset, the important fields are:

🏷 price → continuous numeric variable → (for regression)

📍 city / location → categorical variable (if you want classification, e.g., predict city from features)

🏢 number of bedrooms / bathrooms → features

📏 size (sqft) → feature

📝 description → text data (feature, not usually the target)

So:

If your task is predicting rent amount → the target column = price.

If your task is predicting category (e.g., furnished/unfurnished, city, etc.) → the target would be that specific column.
